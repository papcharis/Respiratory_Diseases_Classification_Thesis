# Respiratory_Diseases_Classification_Thesis
In this repository is available most of the source code written during my Master's Thesis with title Automated Detection and Classification of Respiratory Diseases.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate how the automated detection of 
adventitious sounds on lung sounds operates and to briefly discuss the possibilities of 
implementing the established algorithms on a real-time system. Using the ICBHI 2017 
Challenge Database, an open database including recordings of lung sounds, we explored
different basic deep learning models to classify unhealthy respiratory sounds and compare 
the results to those of the state-of-the-art approaches. Following the algorithmic section, 
we investigate the quantization of the implemented models, which would be essential if a 
real-time system were to be constructed in the future.
This method led to the acquisition of extensive expertise about audio signal 
processing, deep learning models, algorithms, and quantized neural networks. In addition, 
experience with useful technologies such as PyTorch and, more particularly, neural network 
modules and sound processing modules such as librosa was acquired.
